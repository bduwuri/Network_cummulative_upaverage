**HydroGraphNet - Network Cumulative Upstream Average**\
\
Calculates cumulative area-weighted averages of spatial variables across river networks using custom Python implementations.

This tool is designed for hydrological modeling and watershed analysis, enabling efficient aggregation of spatially distributed data (e.g., precipitation, discharge, temperature) over upstream catchments. It is well-suited for applications in river basin modeling, ecohydrology, and spatial network analysis.

\
Key Features:
1. *Upstream Aggregation*: Computes area-weighted averages of spatial variables over all upstream contributing reaches of a river segment.
2. *Modular Python Design*: Separates river network parsing, spatial variable mapping, and cumulative calculations into clean, maintainable modules.
3. *Custom Graph Traversal*: Implements bespoke algorithms for traversing river networks and aggregating data, ensuring accuracy and scalability for large datasets.
4. *Geospatial Integration*: Designed to integrate with GIS-ready datasets and workflows, enabling reproducible spatial analysis.
